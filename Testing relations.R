# Use statustical methods to examine
# the relationships between our vars of interest

# beavers dataset
# contains the body temp of beavers captured every 10 mins
# over a day
# We want to examine difference in average body temp
# to evaluate whether body tem is affected by activity 

# h0: mean beaver temperature is not affected by activity
# h1:mean beaver temperature is affected by activity

?beavers
str(beaver2)

# vars we'll need
# we'll evaluate beaver temp and activity 

# temp = continuous variable 
# activity - categorical dicotomous variable
